	    <p>The Major Minor Training Environment is designed to be flexible, 
	       allowing different users to employ different strategies. 
	       The point of the training environment is to be able to 
	       hear the difference between major and minor keys; this 
	       skill is developed in the sixth training environment. 
	       If you have substantial musical background, you may wish 
	       to start with that trainer; if you are successful with 
	       the sixth trainer there is no need to make further use 
	       of the mini-course, though the seventh lesson may be of 
	       some interest. You may also wish to try the sixth trainer 
	       occasionally while you are working your way through the 
	       rest of the mini-course; if at any time you can use the 
	       sixth trainer successfully (that is, if you answer at 
	       least nine out of the last ten correctly) then there is 
	       no need to continue with the mini-course. Some users may 
	       prefer to start at the beginning and work their way through 
	       the lessons and trainers in order. The mini-course is 
	       structured for these users, and it should be easy to use 
	       in this way. If you prefer a more freewheeling approach, 
	       however, you should feel free to interact with the environments 
	       as you choose.</p>
	     	<p>Although the training environments give you feedback on how many 
	       answers have been correct out of the last ten, it is best 
	       to avoid a test-taking mindset when using them. Take your 
	       time with each sample, using the hint buttons if that 
	       helps you. If you had any doubt about whether your answer 
	       was correct, and especially if you answer was wrong, listen 
	       to the sample again after you give your answer. Before 
	       you go on to the next sample, user the Play Again and 
	       hint buttons until you can hear that the sample is what 
	       the trainer reports it is, either major or minor. This 
	       is the part of the training experience which will be most 
	       helpful in your learning to hear the difference between 
	       major and minor; if you move on to the next sample too 
	       quickly you will learn much more slowly.</p>
	       <p>Finally, remember that the trainers are most effective 
	       when use a little at a time. Especially at the beginning, 
	       you may get discouraged if your score doesn't improve 
	       quickly. If you find yourself getting frustrated, stop 
	       and come back later. The counter for the number of trials 
	       is purely for your own information; you can use the trainer 
	       for as few or as many trials as you choose. You much decide 
	       for yourself when to end each session.</p>
